# Diagnostic plots for an admixr2 fit

Generates up to four diagnostic panels:

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'admFit'
plot(x, which = c("mean", "cov", "nll", "par"), n_sim = NULL, seed = 1L, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An `admFit` object returned by `nlmixr2()` with `est = "admc"` or
  `est = "adirmc"`.

- which:

  Character vector selecting which panel types to produce. Any subset of
  `c("mean", "cov", "nll", "par")`. Defaults to all four.

- n_sim:

  Number of MC samples for the final prediction. Defaults to the value
  used during fitting. Only used when `"mean"` or `"cov"` is in `which`.

- seed:

  Random seed for reproducibility.

- ...:

  Unused.

## Value

A named list of ggplot2 objects, invisibly. Prints each selected plot.

## Details

1.  `"mean"` – Observed vs predicted mean per study (2x2 grid). Upper
    row: observed and predicted mean lines with +/-1 SD ribbon on a
    shared y scale (black throughout). Lower row: raw residual lollipop
    with +/-2 SE band and standardised residual z-scores with +/-1.96
    reference lines.

2.  `"cov"` – Observed vs predicted (co)variance heatmaps per study (2x2
    grid). Upper row shares a common colour scale (blue-white-red).
    Lower row uses distinct diverging scales: residual (red-white-green)
    and standardised residual (gold-white-purple). Significance stars
    overlaid on the standardised residual panel.

3.  `"nll"` – NLL trace per restart over optimizer evaluations. Restarts
    coloured with the Okabe-Ito palette.

4.  `"par"` – Parameter trace per restart on the natural scale (struct
    thetas back-transformed, sigma as SD, omega diagonal as variance
    labelled `V(eta.x)`). Facets ordered as in the model
    [`ini()`](https://nlmixr2.github.io/rxode2/reference/ini.html)
    block. Restarts coloured with the Okabe-Ito palette.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
fit <- nlmixr2(model, admData(), est = "admc", control = admControl(...))

# All panels (default)
plots <- plot(fit)

# Only mean and covariance diagnostics
plot(fit, which = c("mean", "cov"))

# Only traces (no MC simulation needed -- fast)
plot(fit, which = c("nll", "par"))

# Access a specific panel from the returned list
plots$mean_study1   # mean diagnostics for the study named "study1"
plots$cov_study1    # covariance heatmap for "study1"
plots$nll_trace     # NLL trace
plots$par_trace     # parameter trace
} # }
```
